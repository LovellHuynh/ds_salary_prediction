The team enjoys the duality of solving humongous research and engineering problems, while remaining focused on very concrete shorter-term breakthroughs. We believe in excellence, humility, trust and inclusion, and every team member has a veto power on who we hire.
We adopt a finance-first approach to machine learning research, and we do not indulge in blindly applying solutions to machine learning problems in other domains to finance. Core to our research philosophy is the need to place as little assumptions on how the world behaves as possible, but rather let the data speak for itself, and use mathematical rigor to understand what the data is truly saying.
We are backed by Y Combinator, legendary Renaissance Technologies and First Round Capital co-founder Howard Morgan, and prominent tech VCs David Lee & Zal Bilimoria, to name but a few.

Pit.AI Technologies is hiring a Mathematical Scientist. You'll be at the core of our effort to solve intelligence for investment management, and as such, you'll work very closely with the CEO/CTO to improve our current generation of AI-Quants.

This role is an in-house mathematician role. As such, you'll be involved in formulating fundamental questions arising as part of the investment process as mathematical problems consistent with our research philosophy, and you'll be responsible for solving those mathematical problems. This role is central to our research efforts, and your output is expected to have a critical impact on our bottom line, both in the short term and in the long term.

The ideal candidate typically loves (and is capable of) testing and proving complex theorems and conjectures of her/his own, but prefers industry over academia as she/he is eager and impatient to see the impact of her/his work in real-life. She/he never shies away from finding closed-form solutions to complex mathematical problems, but she/he can also gauge the merits of numerical methods as an alternative when appropriate. As much as this is not an engineering role, the ideal candidate should be able to write prototype-quality Python code to test found mathematical results.

Pit.AI Technologies supports publications of methodological findings to top machine learning venues.

We strongly encourage applicants to read our blog posts (http://bit.ly/2Jf97aV) prior to applying, in order to get acquainted with our research philosophy and some of our works.

Requirements:
Ph.D. / Post Doc in Maths from a top university or research group, with an emphasis on stochastic analysis, optimization, and/or functional analysis.
Excellent graduate-level understanding of probability theory, stochastic analysis, functional analysis and optimization, as evidenced for instance by a French DEA in maths, or the Cambridge Part III, prior to your PhD in Maths.
Strong intuition to guide the design of reasonable conjectures from the geometry of the problem and background knowledge prior to attempting any proof.
No finance or machine learning experience is required.

As with an analyst, they organise and analyse data collected by an organisation, such as sales figures, logistics or market research etc. The difference is that a data scientist will use their strong business sense along with an ability to communicate findings to both business and IT leaders in a way that can influence how an organisation approaches a business challenge.
Data scientists may have different functions depending on which industry/sector they are involved in. For example, a data scientist working for Facebook might analyse the types of pages users ‘like’, and then use this information to decide what type of advertisements the user will see when using their Facebook account. They combine practical skills such as coding and maths with the ability to analyse statistics.
The main programming languages often used within analytics, data mining and data science are R, SAS, Python and SQL, while knowledge of Java, C/C++, Perl and Ruby may also be of a value to data scientists. The use of ‘big data’ (collecting or mining huge amounts of data and analysing it) by companies and governments has meant that data scientists are in demand worldwide.
Typically a data scientist needs to:
Use strong business acumen, as well as an ability to communicate findings, and mine vast amounts of data for useful insights
Use these insights to influence how an organisation approaches business challenges
Use a combined knowledge of computer science and applications, modelling, statistics, analytics and maths to solve problems
Extract data from multiple sources
Sift and analyse data from multiple angles, looking for trends that highlight problems or opportunities
Communicate important information and insights to business and IT leaders
Make recommendations to adapt existing business strategies
Typical employers of data scientists
Universities and research institutions
The government
Manufacturers
Banks

Large retailers etc
Big data companies such as Google and Facebook
Marketing agencies and marketing departments at major companies
Data science is a relatively new area of work, but as a progression from data analytics the pay can be fairly high. Pay scale statistics suggest that data science pays £25,000–£50,000 for entry-level posts; however, this should be taken with a pinch of salt. Many will need to start out on a lower rung of the ladder. See our article on how much you can earn in an IT job for information on graduate salaries for jobs that might get you working in data science later on.
Qualifications and training required
There are routes into data science for both graduates and school leavers. A degree in statistics, maths, business administration or computer science is a viable option to pursue a career as a data scientist. School leavers can study a related topic at higher national diploma level or apply for an apprenticeship as a data analyst and progress from there.
To find out about school leaver routes (eg an apprenticeship or school leaver training programme) see the IT section of TARGETcareers, our website aimed at school leavers. As demand for data analysts has risen, many are progressing from this role to fill the need for data scientists. In many graduate cases this is done by further study, such as an MA or PhD, to gain a competitive advantage. The Institute for Direct and Digital Marketing and the Chartered Institute of Marketing also offer professional qualifications and training in subjects related to data science.

As with an analyst, they organise and analyse data collected by an organisation, such as sales figures, logistics or market research etc. The difference is that a data scientist will use their strong business sense along with an ability to communicate findings to both business and IT leaders in a way that can influence how an organisation approaches a business challenge.
Data scientists may have different functions depending on which industry/sector they are involved in. For example, a data scientist working for Facebook might analyse the types of pages users ‘like’, and then use this information to decide what type of advertisements the user will see when using their Facebook account. They combine practical skills such as coding and maths with the ability to analyse statistics.
The main programming languages often used within analytics, data mining and data science are R, SAS, Python and SQL, while knowledge of Java, C/C++, Perl and Ruby may also be of a value to data scientists. The use of ‘big data’ (collecting or mining huge amounts of data and analysing it) by companies and governments has meant that data scientists are in demand worldwide.
Typically a data scientist needs to:
Use strong business acumen, as well as an ability to communicate findings, and mine vast amounts of data for useful insights
Use these insights to influence how an organisation approaches business challenges
Use a combined knowledge of computer science and applications, modelling, statistics, analytics and maths to solve problems
Extract data from multiple sources
Sift and analyse data from multiple angles, looking for trends that highlight problems or opportunities
Communicate important information and insights to business and IT leaders
Make recommendations to adapt existing business strategies
Typical employers of data scientists
Universities and research institutions
The government
Manufacturers
Banks
Airlines
Large retailers etc
Big data companies such as Google and Facebook
Marketing agencies and marketing departments at major companies
Data science is a relatively new area of work, but as a progression from data analytics the pay can be fairly high. Pay scale statistics suggest that data science pays £25,000–£50,000 for entry-level posts; however, this should be taken with a pinch of salt. Many will need to start out on a lower rung of the ladder. See our article on how much you can earn in an IT job for information on graduate salaries for jobs that might get you working in data science later on.
Qualifications and training required
There are routes into data science for both graduates and school leavers. A degree in statistics, maths, business administration or computer science is a viable option to pursue a career as a data scientist. School leavers can study a related topic at higher national diploma level or apply for an apprenticeship as a data analyst and progress from there.
To find out about school leaver routes (eg an apprenticeship or school leaver training programme) see the IT section of TARGETcareers, our website aimed at school leavers. As demand for data analysts has risen, many are progressing from this role to fill the need for data scientists. In many graduate cases this is done by further study, such as an MA or PhD, to gain a competitive advantage. The Institute for Direct and Digital Marketing and the Chartered Institute of Marketing also offer professional qualifications and training in subjects related to data science.
