Our Mission
Lumen Energy is automating clean energy deployment across our cites.
To start, we’re making getting a fully-financed solar energy system for a commercial building as easy as applying for a credit card. The scope of the opportunity is massive: out of 6 million commercial buildings in the US which are responsible for 16% of all greenhouse gas emissions, most of which could save money with solar, fewer than 4% have solar systems today.
We make clean energy widely accessible by abstracting away the complexity of an underlying marketplace of installers, financiers and confusing electrical jargon. Our challenge is to parse massive datasets, deploy advanced models behind the scenes, pre-package financing, all so that we can deliver a simple, delightful, and actionable offer to our customers.
Who We Are
We are a small team of scientists, engineers, designers and entrepreneurs committed to powering our world with clean energy. We build on experience at Stripe, Google X, Shopify, and US national labs. While we're early in our journey, we are live with customers, funded by exceptional investors (soon to be announced), and looking to bring on a core team member who can help us expand our impact.
About you
You like to build. You are comfortable doing the dirty work to make datasets clean and usable. You can apply statistical methods to discover the salient features in novel data. You value reducing complexity and leaving the code base a little better than you found it.
Responsibilities include:
Aggregate and normalize energy and geographic data at a national scale
Analyze customer energy usage to find their most effective path to clean energy
Develop business analytics to keep us running smoothly
Make modeling decisions by working back from business & product needs
Collaborate with external expert advisors at universities and US national labs

Edge & Node (E&N) is looking for a Data Scientist/ Analyst to help drive strategic decisions for its various platforms. E&N is the team behind The Graph, a recently launched decentralized protocol for querying open datasets, which already has thousands of users and multiple billions of dollars in tokens participating in the protocol. Our previously launched hosted service currently powers the most prominent applications in the Ethereum ecosystem, serving billions of queries per month and growing exponentially. We have an energized and vibrant community of users that are passionate about what we're building (https://twitter.com/graphprotocol/timelines/1276305113737424897).
Responsibilities
Produce compelling data-driven narratives that describe what is happening in The Graph and why.
Evangelize the use of data to support improved decision-making throughout E&N and The Graph's ecosystem.
Design and run experiments, such as A/B tests, to increase the growth, retention, and success of users of The Graph.
Apply domain knowledge of relevant topics, such as blockchain, crypto, decentralized finance (DeFi), databases, etc. to identify salient trends and patterns while exploring data sets.
Work with data engineers to define requirements for ETL and data pipelines to produce and automate new data sets to support your analysis.
Skills/ Attributes
Analytical. You effectively break down complex topics and explore new problems from principles.
Curious. You have a growth mindset when it comes to acquiring new knowledge. You enjoy pulling on a thread and seeing where it leads. You see exploring data as a creative as much as an analytical process.
Self-directed: You are able to operate independently in a remote environment and proactively identify the most important tasks to maximize your contribution. You apply domain knowledge to prioritize data-driven investigations that will have the greatest impact on strategic and technical goals.
Expert communicator: You understand that to be effective, presenting your results and recommendations clearly is as important as the analysis itself. You leverage a combination of media, including written reports, blog posts, data visualizations, spreadsheets, analytical notebooks (i.e. Jupyter, Sage, ObservableHQ), dashboards, mathematical writing (i.e. LaTeX), slide decks, and live presentations, choosing the ones most suited for the ideas being communicated.
Team player: People love working with you and your teammates value the way you introduce data-driven insights into conversations to help the team be more effective.
Query Data. You are adept at writing SQL queries and as a bonus are also familiar with GraphQL.
Strongly Recommended
Crypto Native. You have already “fallen down the crypto rabbit hole.” You are familiar with, if not an expert in, concepts like blockchain, distributed systems, bonding curves, decentralized finance (DeFi), consensus, Web3, etc.
Data Engineering. You can write Python or Javascript to post-process data, create interactive notebooks and rich data visualizations or animations.
What it's like to work at Edge & Node
Edge & Node is a globally distributed team. We work hard, but our remote-first team affords a high degree of autonomy and flexibility. Our few scheduled meetings tend to be in the morning, pacific standard time (PST). Most of our team, even at the individual contributor level, has started companies or led large teams and it shows in the way that people manage their own productivity. We're mission-oriented, and hold one another accountable with results rather than vanity metrics like time spent at your desk. If you need to book a vacation, or make a doctor's appointment, go for an afternoon run, or even just get some fresh air, we trust you to use your time effectively.
Despite being remote-first, our team is fairly tight-knit and often feels like a family. You can expect quarterly offsites (once Covid permits) in different parts of the world, where we strategize as a team, brainstorm around a whiteboard, go on team outings, have spirited and varied conversations over wine, coffee, or kombucha, and get to know each other on a personal level. We value diversity and bringing your whole self to work, including your weird hobbies, unique life experiences, cultural traditions, obscure music tastes, and whatever else makes you you. In addition to offsites, you'll have the option to travel to conferences and meetups around the world, where you'll get to know individual teammates on a more personal level and also build relationships with our users and community.
We pay competitive salaries to all team members, based on level of contribution and country of residence, and offer generous health benefits to U.S. based employees.

Please note: All roles at Rhino are remote, and there will be no future in-office mandate.
Our mission is to give renters everywhere greater financial freedom to plan and enjoy their lives.
Our first product eliminates cash security deposits and puts more money back in renters’ pockets. With over $45 billion tied up in security deposits for 110 million renters in the United States alone, it’s time for security deposits to officially become a thing of the past. Tying up money at one of life’s biggest and most expensive moments just isn’t fair.
So we threw out the antiquated “way of doing things” and built a technology-driven insurance product to help bring renting into the 21st century. With Rhino, millions of renters across the country now have the opportunity to save with our award-winning deposit insurance. We’ve already saved hundreds of millions of dollars for renters and are trusted in over 1 million homes nationwide, and most importantly, we’re just getting started...
As a member of the Data Science Team at Rhino, you will be partnering with Data Engineers and business teams to solve business problems by doing scalable research on the world of renting and by building models and data tools to turn insights into business decisions. You will collaborate with and learn from fellow Data Scientists through project brainstorming sessions, knowledge shares and code review.
In this role you will:
Partner with Finance, Revenue, Ops, Marketing & Product teams to define business problems, scope Data Science solutions and represent Data’s voice in the room.
Build predictive models to optimize Pricing, Marketing, Operations and Sales.
Build analyses and tools to understand our partners and renters and their pain points.
Explore and test new data sources to improve our Risk models and marketing targeting.
Actively contribute to Rhino’s Data culture by building out core data models, tooling and best practices as well as training other Rhinos on using our data effectively.
We’re ideally seeking:
You have an advanced degree in a quantitative field or 2+ years of work experience in an analytical role.
You use data science tools like SQL and Python (pandas, numpy) and you have a track record of picking up new tools along the way.
You are able to zoom in and out of problems and navigate comfortably between high level strategic thinking and communication and granular methods of problem solving.
You have experience in one or more of the following areas: experimental design, web tracking and attribution, predictive modeling (supervised learning), customer segmentation models, frequentist and Bayesian statistics, building custom web apps.
You are excited to join a rapidly growing company and to work cross functionally to drive business impact.
Benefits:
Competitive compensation and 401k
Unlimited PTO to give our employees a little extra R&R when they need it
Stock option plan to give our employees a direct stake in Rhino’s success
Comprehensive health coverage (medical, dental, vision)
Remote Work Program to allow for flexibility between home and the office
Generous Parental Leave to create a family-friendly culture
Wellness Perks (Gym, Classpass, & Citibike Memberships)

Pit.AI Technologies is taking on one of the most exciting challenges of our time, namely solving intelligence, in one of the most competitive industries ever, investment management!
The team enjoys the duality of solving humongous research and engineering problems, while remaining focused on very concrete shorter-term breakthroughs. We believe in excellence, humility, trust and inclusion, and every team member has a veto power on who we hire.
We adopt a finance-first approach to machine learning research, and we do not indulge in blindly applying solutions to machine learning problems in other domains to finance. Core to our research philosophy is the need to place as little assumptions on how the world behaves as possible, but rather let the data speak for itself, and use mathematical rigor to understand what the data is truly saying.
We are backed by Y Combinator, legendary Renaissance Technologies and First Round Capital co-founder Howard Morgan, and prominent tech VCs David Lee & Zal Bilimoria, to name but a few.

Pit.AI Technologies is hiring a Mathematical Scientist. You'll be at the core of our effort to solve intelligence for investment management, and as such, you'll work very closely with the CEO/CTO to improve our current generation of AI-Quants.

This role is an in-house mathematician role. As such, you'll be involved in formulating fundamental questions arising as part of the investment process as mathematical problems consistent with our research philosophy, and you'll be responsible for solving those mathematical problems. This role is central to our research efforts, and your output is expected to have a critical impact on our bottom line, both in the short term and in the long term.

The ideal candidate typically loves (and is capable of) testing and proving complex theorems and conjectures of her/his own, but prefers industry over academia as she/he is eager and impatient to see the impact of her/his work in real-life. She/he never shies away from finding closed-form solutions to complex mathematical problems, but she/he can also gauge the merits of numerical methods as an alternative when appropriate. As much as this is not an engineering role, the ideal candidate should be able to write prototype-quality Python code to test found mathematical results.

Pit.AI Technologies supports publications of methodological findings to top machine learning venues.

We strongly encourage applicants to read our blog posts (http://bit.ly/2Jf97aV) prior to applying, in order to get acquainted with our research philosophy and some of our works.

Requirements:
Ph.D. / Post Doc in Maths from a top university or research group, with an emphasis on stochastic analysis, optimization, and/or functional analysis.
Excellent graduate-level understanding of probability theory, stochastic analysis, functional analysis and optimization, as evidenced for instance by a French DEA in maths, or the Cambridge Part III, prior to your PhD in Maths.
Strong intuition to guide the design of reasonable conjectures from the geometry of the problem and background knowledge prior to attempting any proof.
No finance or machine learning experience is required.

Job Type : Full-time
The role of a data scientist has evolved and expanded from that of a data analyst. As with an analyst, they organise and analyse data collected by an organisation, such as sales figures, logistics or market research etc. The difference is that a data scientist will use their strong business sense along with an ability to communicate findings to both business and IT leaders in a way that can influence how an organisation approaches a business challenge.
Data scientists may have different functions depending on which industry/sector they are involved in. For example, a data scientist working for Facebook might analyse the types of pages users ‘like’, and then use this information to decide what type of advertisements the user will see when using their Facebook account. They combine practical skills such as coding and maths with the ability to analyse statistics.
The main programming languages often used within analytics, data mining and data science are R, SAS, Python and SQL, while knowledge of Java, C/C++, Perl and Ruby may also be of a value to data scientists. The use of ‘big data’ (collecting or mining huge amounts of data and analysing it) by companies and governments has meant that data scientists are in demand worldwide.
Typically a data scientist needs to:
Use strong business acumen, as well as an ability to communicate findings, and mine vast amounts of data for useful insights
Use these insights to influence how an organisation approaches business challenges
Use a combined knowledge of computer science and applications, modelling, statistics, analytics and maths to solve problems
Extract data from multiple sources
Sift and analyse data from multiple angles, looking for trends that highlight problems or opportunities
Communicate important information and insights to business and IT leaders
Make recommendations to adapt existing business strategies
Typical employers of data scientists
Universities and research institutions
The government
Manufacturers
Banks
Airlines
Large retailers etc
Big data companies such as Google and Facebook
Marketing agencies and marketing departments at major companies
Data science is a relatively new area of work, but as a progression from data analytics the pay can be fairly high. Pay scale statistics suggest that data science pays £25,000–£50,000 for entry-level posts; however, this should be taken with a pinch of salt. Many will need to start out on a lower rung of the ladder. See our article on how much you can earn in an IT job for information on graduate salaries for jobs that might get you working in data science later on.
Qualifications and training required
There are routes into data science for both graduates and school leavers. A degree in statistics, maths, business administration or computer science is a viable option to pursue a career as a data scientist. School leavers can study a related topic at higher national diploma level or apply for an apprenticeship as a data analyst and progress from there.
To find out about school leaver routes (eg an apprenticeship or school leaver training programme) see the IT section of TARGETcareers, our website aimed at school leavers. As demand for data analysts has risen, many are progressing from this role to fill the need for data scientists. In many graduate cases this is done by further study, such as an MA or PhD, to gain a competitive advantage. The Institute for Direct and Digital Marketing and the Chartered Institute of Marketing also offer professional qualifications and training in subjects related to data science.

Easy Apply
2d
Job Type : Full-time
The role of a data scientist has evolved and expanded from that of a data analyst. As with an analyst, they organise and analyse data collected by an organisation, such as sales figures, logistics or market research etc. The difference is that a data scientist will use their strong business sense along with an ability to communicate findings to both business and IT leaders in a way that can influence how an organisation approaches a business challenge.
Data scientists may have different functions depending on which industry/sector they are involved in. For example, a data scientist working for Facebook might analyse the types of pages users ‘like’, and then use this information to decide what type of advertisements the user will see when using their Facebook account. They combine practical skills such as coding and maths with the ability to analyse statistics.
The main programming languages often used within analytics, data mining and data science are R, SAS, Python and SQL, while knowledge of Java, C/C++, Perl and Ruby may also be of a value to data scientists. The use of ‘big data’ (collecting or mining huge amounts of data and analysing it) by companies and governments has meant that data scientists are in demand worldwide.
Typically a data scientist needs to:
Use strong business acumen, as well as an ability to communicate findings, and mine vast amounts of data for useful insights
Use these insights to influence how an organisation approaches business challenges
Use a combined knowledge of computer science and applications, modelling, statistics, analytics and maths to solve problems
Extract data from multiple sources
Sift and analyse data from multiple angles, looking for trends that highlight problems or opportunities
Communicate important information and insights to business and IT leaders
Make recommendations to adapt existing business strategies
Typical employers of data scientists
Universities and research institutions
The government
Manufacturers
Banks
Airlines
Large retailers etc
Big data companies such as Google and Facebook
Marketing agencies and marketing departments at major companies
Data science is a relatively new area of work, but as a progression from data analytics the pay can be fairly high. Pay scale statistics suggest that data science pays £25,000–£50,000 for entry-level posts; however, this should be taken with a pinch of salt. Many will need to start out on a lower rung of the ladder. See our article on how much you can earn in an IT job for information on graduate salaries for jobs that might get you working in data science later on.
Qualifications and training required
There are routes into data science for both graduates and school leavers. A degree in statistics, maths, business administration or computer science is a viable option to pursue a career as a data scientist. School leavers can study a related topic at higher national diploma level or apply for an apprenticeship as a data analyst and progress from there.
To find out about school leaver routes (eg an apprenticeship or school leaver training programme) see the IT section of TARGETcareers, our website aimed at school leavers. As demand for data analysts has risen, many are progressing from this role to fill the need for data scientists. In many graduate cases this is done by further study, such as an MA or PhD, to gain a competitive advantage. The Institute for Direct and Digital Marketing and the Chartered Institute of Marketing also offer professional qualifications and training in subjects related to data science.

The Company You’ll Join
At Carta we create owners and make private markets liquid.
We live in a world where some people live on the equity stack and enjoy exponential wealth growth and preferential tax treatment; others live on the debt stack and may work their entire lives for a company and retire only with the cash they’ve managed to save from their paychecks. Our contribution to solving the wealth inequality problem is moving people from the debt stack (payroll) to the equity stack. By making it as easy to issue equity to employees as it is to put them on payroll, we can create more owners.
At Carta, we are helpful, transparent, fair, and kind. We are relentless executors, unconventional thinkers, and masters of our craft.

Job Type : Full-time
The role of a data scientist has evolved and expanded from that of a data analyst. As with an analyst, they organise and analyse data collected by an organisation, such as sales figures, logistics or market research etc. The difference is that a data scientist will use their strong business sense along with an ability to communicate findings to both business and IT leaders in a way that can influence how an organisation approaches a business challenge.
Data scientists may have different functions depending on which industry/sector they are involved in. For example, a data scientist working for Facebook might analyse the types of pages users ‘like’, and then use this information to decide what type of advertisements the user will see when using their Facebook account. They combine practical skills such as coding and maths with the ability to analyse statistics.
The main programming languages often used within analytics, data mining and data science are R, SAS, Python and SQL, while knowledge of Java, C/C++, Perl and Ruby may also be of a value to data scientists. The use of ‘big data’ (collecting or mining huge amounts of data and analysing it) by companies and governments has meant that data scientists are in demand worldwide.
Typically a data scientist needs to:
Use strong business acumen, as well as an ability to communicate findings, and mine vast amounts of data for useful insights
Use these insights to influence how an organisation approaches business challenges
Use a combined knowledge of computer science and applications, modelling, statistics, analytics and maths to solve problems
Extract data from multiple sources
Sift and analyse data from multiple angles, looking for trends that highlight problems or opportunities
Communicate important information and insights to business and IT leaders
Make recommendations to adapt existing business strategies
Typical employers of data scientists
Universities and research institutions
The government
Manufacturers
Banks
Airlines
Large retailers etc
Big data companies such as Google and Facebook
Marketing agencies and marketing departments at major companies
Data science is a relatively new area of work, but as a progression from data analytics the pay can be fairly high. Pay scale statistics suggest that data science pays £25,000–£50,000 for entry-level posts; however, this should be taken with a pinch of salt. Many will need to start out on a lower rung of the ladder. See our article on how much you can earn in an IT job for information on graduate salaries for jobs that might get you working in data science later on.
Qualifications and training required
There are routes into data science for both graduates and school leavers. A degree in statistics, maths, business administration or computer science is a viable option to pursue a career as a data scientist. School leavers can study a related topic at higher national diploma level or apply for an apprenticeship as a data analyst and progress from there.
To find out about school leaver routes (eg an apprenticeship or school leaver training programme) see the IT section of TARGETcareers, our website aimed at school leavers. As demand for data analysts has risen, many are progressing from this role to fill the need for data scientists. In many graduate cases this is done by further study, such as an MA or PhD, to gain a competitive advantage. The Institute for Direct and Digital Marketing and the Chartered Institute of Marketing also offer professional qualifications and training in subjects related to data science.

We make clean energy widely accessible by abstracting away the complexity of an underlying marketplace of installers, financiers and confusing electrical jargon. Our challenge is to parse massive datasets, deploy advanced models behind the scenes, pre-package financing, all so that we can deliver a simple, delightful, and actionable offer to our customers.
Who We Are
We are a small team of scientists, engineers, designers and entrepreneurs committed to powering our world with clean energy. We build on experience at Stripe, Google X, Shopify, and US national labs. While we're early in our journey, we are live with customers, funded by exceptional investors (soon to be announced), and looking to bring on a core team member who can help us expand our impact.
About you
You like to build. You are comfortable doing the dirty work to make datasets clean and usable. You can apply statistical methods to discover the salient features in novel data. You value reducing complexity and leaving the code base a little better than you found it.
Responsibilities include:
Aggregate and normalize energy and geographic data at a national scale
Analyze customer energy usage to find their most effective path to clean energy
Develop business analytics to keep us running smoothly
Make modeling decisions by working back from business & product needs
Collaborate with external expert advisors at universities and US national labs

Edge & Node (E&N) is looking for a Data Scientist/ Analyst to help drive strategic decisions for its various platforms. E&N is the team behind The Graph, a recently launched decentralized protocol for querying open datasets, which already has thousands of users and multiple billions of dollars in tokens participating in the protocol. Our previously launched hosted service currently powers the most prominent applications in the Ethereum ecosystem, serving billions of queries per month and growing exponentially. We have an energized and vibrant community of users that are passionate about what we're building (https://twitter.com/graphprotocol/timelines/1276305113737424897).
Responsibilities
Produce compelling data-driven narratives that describe what is happening in The Graph and why.
Evangelize the use of data to support improved decision-making throughout E&N and The Graph's ecosystem.
Design and run experiments, such as A/B tests, to increase the growth, retention, and success of users of The Graph.
Apply domain knowledge of relevant topics, such as blockchain, crypto, decentralized finance (DeFi), databases, etc. to identify salient trends and patterns while exploring data sets.
Work with data engineers to define requirements for ETL and data pipelines to produce and automate new data sets to support your analysis.
Skills/ Attributes
Analytical. You effectively break down complex topics and explore new problems from principles.
Curious. You have a growth mindset when it comes to acquiring new knowledge. You enjoy pulling on a thread and seeing where it leads. You see exploring data as a creative as much as an analytical process.
Self-directed: You are able to operate independently in a remote environment and proactively identify the most important tasks to maximize your contribution. You apply domain knowledge to prioritize data-driven investigations that will have the greatest impact on strategic and technical goals.
Expert communicator: You understand that to be effective, presenting your results and recommendations clearly is as important as the analysis itself. You leverage a combination of media, including written reports, blog posts, data visualizations, spreadsheets, analytical notebooks (i.e. Jupyter, Sage, ObservableHQ), dashboards, mathematical writing (i.e. LaTeX), slide decks, and live presentations, choosing the ones most suited for the ideas being communicated.
Team player: People love working with you and your teammates value the way you introduce data-driven insights into conversations to help the team be more effective.
Query Data. You are adept at writing SQL queries and as a bonus are also familiar with GraphQL.
Strongly Recommended
Crypto Native. You have already “fallen down the crypto rabbit hole.” You are familiar with, if not an expert in, concepts like blockchain, distributed systems, bonding curves, decentralized finance (DeFi), consensus, Web3, etc.
Data Engineering. You can write Python or Javascript to post-process data, create interactive notebooks and rich data visualizations or animations.
What it's like to work at Edge & Node
Edge & Node is a globally distributed team. We work hard, but our remote-first team affords a high degree of autonomy and flexibility. Our few scheduled meetings tend to be in the morning, pacific standard time (PST). Most of our team, even at the individual contributor level, has started companies or led large teams and it shows in the way that people manage their own productivity. We're mission-oriented, and hold one another accountable with results rather than vanity metrics like time spent at your desk. If you need to book a vacation, or make a doctor's appointment, go for an afternoon run, or even just get some fresh air, we trust you to use your time effectively.
Despite being remote-first, our team is fairly tight-knit and often feels like a family. You can expect quarterly offsites (once Covid permits) in different parts of the world, where we strategize as a team, brainstorm around a whiteboard, go on team outings, have spirited and varied conversations over wine, coffee, or kombucha, and get to know each other on a personal level. We value diversity and bringing your whole self to work, including your weird hobbies, unique life experiences, cultural traditions, obscure music tastes, and whatever else makes you you. In addition to offsites, you'll have the option to travel to conferences and meetups around the world, where you'll get to know individual teammates on a more personal level and also build relationships with our users and community.
We pay competitive salaries to all team members, based on level of contribution and country of residence, and offer generous health benefits to U.S. based employees.

The scope of the opportunity is massive: out of 6 million commercial buildings in the US which are responsible for 16% of all greenhouse gas emissions, most of which could save money with solar, fewer than 4% have solar systems today.
We make clean energy widely accessible by abstracting away the complexity of an underlying marketplace of installers, financiers and confusing electrical jargon. Our challenge is to parse massive datasets, deploy advanced models behind the scenes, pre-package financing, all so that we can deliver a simple, delightful, and actionable offer to our customers.
Who We Are
We are a small team of scientists, engineers, designers and entrepreneurs committed to powering our world with clean energy. We build on experience at Stripe, Google X, Shopify, and US national labs. While we're early in our journey, we are live with customers, funded by exceptional investors (soon to be announced), and looking to bring on a core team member who can help us expand our impact.
About you
You like to build. You are comfortable doing the dirty work to make datasets clean and usable. You can apply statistical methods to discover the salient features in novel data. You value reducing complexity and leaving the code base a little better than you found it.
Responsibilities include:
Aggregate and normalize energy and geographic data at a national scale
Analyze customer energy usage to find their most effective path to clean energy
Develop business analytics to keep us running smoothly
Make modeling decisions by working back from business & product needs
Collaborate with external expert advisors at universities and US national labs

Our Mission
Lumen Energy is automating clean energy deployment across our cites.
To start, we’re making getting a fully-financed solar energy system for a commercial building as easy as applying for a credit card. The scope of the opportunity is massive: out of 6 million commercial buildings in the US which are responsible for 16% of all greenhouse gas emissions, most of which could save money with solar, fewer than 4% have solar systems today.
We make clean energy widely accessible by abstracting away the complexity of an underlying marketplace of installers, financiers and confusing electrical jargon. Our challenge is to parse massive datasets, deploy advanced models behind the scenes, pre-package financing, all so that we can deliver a simple, delightful, and actionable offer to our customers.
Who We Are
We are a small team of scientists, engineers, designers and entrepreneurs committed to powering our world with clean energy. We build on experience at Stripe, Google X, Shopify, and US national labs. While we're early in our journey, we are live with customers, funded by exceptional investors (soon to be announced), and looking to bring on a core team member who can help us expand our impact.
About you
You like to build. You are comfortable doing the dirty work to make datasets clean and usable. You can apply statistical methods to discover the salient features in novel data. You value reducing complexity and leaving the code base a little better than you found it.
Responsibilities include:
Aggregate and normalize energy and geographic data at a national scale
Analyze customer energy usage to find their most effective path to clean energy
Develop business analytics to keep us running smoothly
Make modeling decisions by working back from business & product needs
Collaborate with external expert advisors at universities and US national labs

Our Mission
Lumen Energy is automating clean energy deployment across our cites.
To start, we’re making getting a fully-financed solar energy system for a commercial building as easy as applying for a credit card. The scope of the opportunity is massive: out of 6 million commercial buildings in the US which are responsible for 16% of all greenhouse gas emissions, most of which could save money with solar, fewer than 4% have solar systems today.
We make clean energy widely accessible by abstracting away the complexity of an underlying marketplace of installers, financiers and confusing electrical jargon. Our challenge is to parse massive datasets, deploy advanced models behind the scenes, pre-package financing, all so that we can deliver a simple, delightful, and actionable offer to our customers.
Who We Are
We are a small team of scientists, engineers, designers and entrepreneurs committed to powering our world with clean energy. We build on experience at Stripe, Google X, Shopify, and US national labs. While we're early in our journey, we are live with customers, funded by exceptional investors (soon to be announced), and looking to bring on a core team member who can help us expand our impact.
About you
You like to build. You are comfortable doing the dirty work to make datasets clean and usable. You can apply statistical methods to discover the salient features in novel data. You value reducing complexity and leaving the code base a little better than you found it.
Responsibilities include:
Aggregate and normalize energy and geographic data at a national scale
Analyze customer energy usage to find their most effective path to clean energy
Develop business analytics to keep us running smoothly
Make modeling decisions by working back from business & product needs
Collaborate with external expert advisors at universities and US national labs

While we're early in our journey, we are live with customers, funded by exceptional investors (soon to be announced), and looking to bring on a core team member who can help us expand our impact.
About you
You like to build. You are comfortable doing the dirty work to make datasets clean and usable. You can apply statistical methods to discover the salient features in novel data. You value reducing complexity and leaving the code base a little better than you found it.
Responsibilities include:
Aggregate and normalize energy and geographic data at a national scale
Analyze customer energy usage to find their most effective path to clean energy
Develop business analytics to keep us running smoothly
Make modeling decisions by working back from business & product needs
Collaborate with external expert advisors at universities and US national labs

Edge & Node (E&N) is looking for a Data Scientist/ Analyst to help drive strategic decisions for its various platforms. E&N is the team behind The Graph, a recently launched decentralized protocol for querying open datasets, which already has thousands of users and multiple billions of dollars in tokens participating in the protocol. Our previously launched hosted service currently powers the most prominent applications in the Ethereum ecosystem, serving billions of queries per month and growing exponentially. We have an energized and vibrant community of users that are passionate about what we're building (https://twitter.com/graphprotocol/timelines/1276305113737424897).
Responsibilities
Produce compelling data-driven narratives that describe what is happening in The Graph and why.
Evangelize the use of data to support improved decision-making throughout E&N and The Graph's ecosystem.
Design and run experiments, such as A/B tests, to increase the growth, retention, and success of users of The Graph.
Apply domain knowledge of relevant topics, such as blockchain, crypto, decentralized finance (DeFi), databases, etc. to identify salient trends and patterns while exploring data sets.
Work with data engineers to define requirements for ETL and data pipelines to produce and automate new data sets to support your analysis.
Skills/ Attributes
Analytical. You effectively break down complex topics and explore new problems from principles.
Curious. You have a growth mindset when it comes to acquiring new knowledge. You enjoy pulling on a thread and seeing where it leads. You see exploring data as a creative as much as an analytical process.
Self-directed: You are able to operate independently in a remote environment and proactively identify the most important tasks to maximize your contribution. You apply domain knowledge to prioritize data-driven investigations that will have the greatest impact on strategic and technical goals.
Expert communicator: You understand that to be effective, presenting your results and recommendations clearly is as important as the analysis itself. You leverage a combination of media, including written reports, blog posts, data visualizations, spreadsheets, analytical notebooks (i.e. Jupyter, Sage, ObservableHQ), dashboards, mathematical writing (i.e. LaTeX), slide decks, and live presentations, choosing the ones most suited for the ideas being communicated.
Team player: People love working with you and your teammates value the way you introduce data-driven insights into conversations to help the team be more effective.
Query Data. You are adept at writing SQL queries and as a bonus are also familiar with GraphQL.
Strongly Recommended
Crypto Native. You have already “fallen down the crypto rabbit hole.” You are familiar with, if not an expert in, concepts like blockchain, distributed systems, bonding curves, decentralized finance (DeFi), consensus, Web3, etc.
Data Engineering. You can write Python or Javascript to post-process data, create interactive notebooks and rich data visualizations or animations.
What it's like to work at Edge & Node
Edge & Node is a globally distributed team. We work hard, but our remote-first team affords a high degree of autonomy and flexibility. Our few scheduled meetings tend to be in the morning, pacific standard time (PST). Most of our team, even at the individual contributor level, has started companies or led large teams and it shows in the way that people manage their own productivity. We're mission-oriented, and hold one another accountable with results rather than vanity metrics like time spent at your desk. If you need to book a vacation, or make a doctor's appointment, go for an afternoon run, or even just get some fresh air, we trust you to use your time effectively.
Despite being remote-first, our team is fairly tight-knit and often feels like a family. You can expect quarterly offsites (once Covid permits) in different parts of the world, where we strategize as a team, brainstorm around a whiteboard, go on team outings, have spirited and varied conversations over wine, coffee, or kombucha, and get to know each other on a personal level. We value diversity and bringing your whole self to work, including your weird hobbies, unique life experiences, cultural traditions, obscure music tastes, and whatever else makes you you. In addition to offsites, you'll have the option to travel to conferences and meetups around the world, where you'll get to know individual teammates on a more personal level and also build relationships with our users and community.
We pay competitive salaries to all team members, based on level of contribution and country of residence, and offer generous health benefits to U.S. based employees.

About you
You like to build. You are comfortable doing the dirty work to make datasets clean and usable. You can apply statistical methods to discover the salient features in novel data. You value reducing complexity and leaving the code base a little better than you found it.
Responsibilities include:
Aggregate and normalize energy and geographic data at a national scale
Analyze customer energy usage to find their most effective path to clean energy
Develop business analytics to keep us running smoothly
Make modeling decisions by working back from business & product needs
Collaborate with external expert advisors at universities and US national labs

Description
The Junior Data Scientist will work within the Commercial and Product teams to position, build, and market Barchart’s products and services to current and prospective customers.

Edge & Node (E&N) is looking for a Data Scientist/ Analyst to help drive strategic decisions for its various platforms. E&N is the team behind The Graph, a recently launched decentralized protocol for querying open datasets, which already has thousands of users and multiple billions of dollars in tokens participating in the protocol. Our previously launched hosted service currently powers the most prominent applications in the Ethereum ecosystem, serving billions of queries per month and growing exponentially. We have an energized and vibrant community of users that are passionate about what we're building (https://twitter.com/graphprotocol/timelines/1276305113737424897).
Responsibilities
Produce compelling data-driven narratives that describe what is happening in The Graph and why.
Evangelize the use of data to support improved decision-making throughout E&N and The Graph's ecosystem.
Design and run experiments, such as A/B tests, to increase the growth, retention, and success of users of The Graph.
Apply domain knowledge of relevant topics, such as blockchain, crypto, decentralized finance (DeFi), databases, etc. to identify salient trends and patterns while exploring data sets.
Work with data engineers to define requirements for ETL and data pipelines to produce and automate new data sets to support your analysis.
Skills/ Attributes
Analytical. You effectively break down complex topics and explore new problems from principles.
Curious. You have a growth mindset when it comes to acquiring new knowledge. You enjoy pulling on a thread and seeing where it leads. You see exploring data as a creative as much as an analytical process.
Self-directed: You are able to operate independently in a remote environment and proactively identify the most important tasks to maximize your contribution. You apply domain knowledge to prioritize data-driven investigations that will have the greatest impact on strategic and technical goals.
Expert communicator: You understand that to be effective, presenting your results and recommendations clearly is as important as the analysis itself. You leverage a combination of media, including written reports, blog posts, data visualizations, spreadsheets, analytical notebooks (i.e. Jupyter, Sage, ObservableHQ), dashboards, mathematical writing (i.e. LaTeX), slide decks, and live presentations, choosing the ones most suited for the ideas being communicated.
Team player: People love working with you and your teammates value the way you introduce data-driven insights into conversations to help the team be more effective.
Query Data. You are adept at writing SQL queries and as a bonus are also familiar with GraphQL.
Strongly Recommended
Crypto Native. You have already “fallen down the crypto rabbit hole.” You are familiar with, if not an expert in, concepts like blockchain, distributed systems, bonding curves, decentralized finance (DeFi), consensus, Web3, etc.
Data Engineering. You can write Python or Javascript to post-process data, create interactive notebooks and rich data visualizations or animations.
What it's like to work at Edge & Node
Edge & Node is a globally distributed team. We work hard, but our remote-first team affords a high degree of autonomy and flexibility. Our few scheduled meetings tend to be in the morning, pacific standard time (PST). Most of our team, even at the individual contributor level, has started companies or led large teams and it shows in the way that people manage their own productivity. We're mission-oriented, and hold one another accountable with results rather than vanity metrics like time spent at your desk. If you need to book a vacation, or make a doctor's appointment, go for an afternoon run, or even just get some fresh air, we trust you to use your time effectively.
Despite being remote-first, our team is fairly tight-knit and often feels like a family. You can expect quarterly offsites (once Covid permits) in different parts of the world, where we strategize as a team, brainstorm around a whiteboard, go on team outings, have spirited and varied conversations over wine, coffee, or kombucha, and get to know each other on a personal level. We value diversity and bringing your whole self to work, including your weird hobbies, unique life experiences, cultural traditions, obscure music tastes, and whatever else makes you you. In addition to offsites, you'll have the option to travel to conferences and meetups around the world, where you'll get to know individual teammates on a more personal level and also build relationships with our users and community.
We pay competitive salaries to all team members, based on level of contribution and country of residence, and offer generous health benefits to U.S. based employees.

While we're early in our journey, we are live with customers, funded by exceptional investors (soon to be announced), and looking to bring on a core team member who can help us expand our impact.
About you
You like to build. You are comfortable doing the dirty work to make datasets clean and usable. You can apply statistical methods to discover the salient features in novel data. You value reducing complexity and leaving the code base a little better than you found it.
Responsibilities include:
Aggregate and normalize energy and geographic data at a national scale
Analyze customer energy usage to find their most effective path to clean energy
Develop business analytics to keep us running smoothly
Make modeling decisions by working back from business & product needs

Our Mission
Lumen Energy is automating clean energy deployment across our cites.
To start, we’re making getting a fully-financed solar energy system for a commercial building as easy as applying for a credit card. The scope of the opportunity is massive: out of 6 million commercial buildings in the US which are responsible for 16% of all greenhouse gas emissions, most of which could save money with solar, fewer than 4% have solar systems today.
We make clean energy widely accessible by abstracting away the complexity of an underlying marketplace of installers, financiers and confusing electrical jargon. Our challenge is to parse massive datasets, deploy advanced models behind the scenes, pre-package financing, all so that we can deliver a simple, delightful, and actionable offer to our customers.

Our Mission
Lumen Energy is automating clean energy deployment across our cites.
To start, we’re making getting a fully-financed solar energy system for a commercial building as easy as applying for a credit card. The scope of the opportunity is massive: out of 6 million commercial buildings in the US which are responsible for 16% of all greenhouse gas emissions, most of which could save money with solar, fewer than 4% have solar systems today.
We make clean energy widely accessible by abstracting away the complexity of an underlying marketplace of installers, financiers and confusing electrical jargon. Our challenge is to parse massive datasets, deploy advanced models behind the scenes, pre-package financing, all so that we can deliver a simple, delightful, and actionable offer to our customers.
Who We Are
We are a small team of scientists, engineers, designers and entrepreneurs committed to powering our world with clean energy. We build on experience at Stripe, Google X, Shopify, and US national labs. While we're early in our journey, we are live with customers, funded by exceptional investors (soon to be announced), and looking to bring on a core team member who can help us expand our impact.
About you
You like to build. You are comfortable doing the dirty work to make datasets clean and usable. You can apply statistical methods to discover the salient features in novel data. You value reducing complexity and leaving the code base a little better than you found it.
Responsibilities include:
Aggregate and normalize energy and geographic data at a national scale
Analyze customer energy usage to find their most effective path to clean energy
Develop business analytics to keep us running smoothly
Make modeling decisions by working back from business & product needs
Collaborate with external expert advisors at universities and US national labs

While we're early in our journey, we are live with customers, funded by exceptional investors (soon to be announced), and looking to bring on a core team member who can help us expand our impact.
About you
You like to build. You are comfortable doing the dirty work to make datasets clean and usable. You can apply statistical methods to discover the salient features in novel data. You value reducing complexity and leaving the code base a little better than you found it.
Responsibilities include:
Aggregate and normalize energy and geographic data at a national scale
Analyze customer energy usage to find their most effective path to clean energy
Develop business analytics to keep us running smoothly
Make modeling decisions by working back from business & product needs
Collaborate with external expert advisors at universities and US national labs

Edge & Node (E&N) is looking for a Data Scientist/ Analyst to help drive strategic decisions for its various platforms. E&N is the team behind The Graph, a recently launched decentralized protocol for querying open datasets, which already has thousands of users and multiple billions of dollars in tokens participating in the protocol. Our previously launched hosted service currently powers the most prominent applications in the Ethereum ecosystem, serving billions of queries per month and growing exponentially. We have an energized and vibrant community of users that are passionate about what we're building (https://twitter.com/graphprotocol/timelines/1276305113737424897).
Responsibilities
Produce compelling data-driven narratives that describe what is happening in The Graph and why.
Evangelize the use of data to support improved decision-making throughout E&N and The Graph's ecosystem.
Design and run experiments, such as A/B tests, to increase the growth, retention, and success of users of The Graph.
Apply domain knowledge of relevant topics, such as blockchain, crypto, decentralized finance (DeFi), databases, etc. to identify salient trends and patterns while exploring data sets.
Work with data engineers to define requirements for ETL and data pipelines to produce and automate new data sets to support your analysis.
Skills/ Attributes
Analytical. You effectively break down complex topics and explore new problems from principles.
Curious. You have a growth mindset when it comes to acquiring new knowledge. You enjoy pulling on a thread and seeing where it leads. You see exploring data as a creative as much as an analytical process.
Self-directed: You are able to operate independently in a remote environment and proactively identify the most important tasks to maximize your contribution. You apply domain knowledge to prioritize data-driven investigations that will have the greatest impact on strategic and technical goals.
Expert communicator: You understand that to be effective, presenting your results and recommendations clearly is as important as the analysis itself. You leverage a combination of media, including written reports, blog posts, data visualizations, spreadsheets, analytical notebooks (i.e. Jupyter, Sage, ObservableHQ), dashboards, mathematical writing (i.e. LaTeX), slide decks, and live presentations, choosing the ones most suited for the ideas being communicated.
Team player: People love working with you and your teammates value the way you introduce data-driven insights into conversations to help the team be more effective.
Query Data. You are adept at writing SQL queries and as a bonus are also familiar with GraphQL.
Strongly Recommended
Crypto Native. You have already “fallen down the crypto rabbit hole.” You are familiar with, if not an expert in, concepts like blockchain, distributed systems, bonding curves, decentralized finance (DeFi), consensus, Web3, etc.
Data Engineering. You can write Python or Javascript to post-process data, create interactive notebooks and rich data visualizations or animations.
What it's like to work at Edge & Node
Edge & Node is a globally distributed team. We work hard, but our remote-first team affords a high degree of autonomy and flexibility. Our few scheduled meetings tend to be in the morning, pacific standard time (PST). Most of our team, even at the individual contributor level, has started companies or led large teams and it shows in the way that people manage their own productivity. We're mission-oriented, and hold one another accountable with results rather than vanity metrics like time spent at your desk. If you need to book a vacation, or make a doctor's appointment, go for an afternoon run, or even just get some fresh air, we trust you to use your time effectively.
Despite being remote-first, our team is fairly tight-knit and often feels like a family. You can expect quarterly offsites (once Covid permits) in different parts of the world, where we strategize as a team, brainstorm around a whiteboard, go on team outings, have spirited and varied conversations over wine, coffee, or kombucha, and get to know each other on a personal level. We value diversity and bringing your whole self to work, including your weird hobbies, unique life experiences, cultural traditions, obscure music tastes, and whatever else makes you you. In addition to offsites, you'll have the option to travel to conferences and meetups around the world, where you'll get to know individual teammates on a more personal level and also build relationships with our users and community.
We pay competitive salaries to all team members, based on level of contribution and country of residence, and offer generous health benefits to U.S. based employees.

Edge & Node (E&N) is looking for a Data Scientist/ Analyst to help drive strategic decisions for its various platforms. E&N is the team behind The Graph, a recently launched decentralized protocol for querying open datasets, which already has thousands of users and multiple billions of dollars in tokens participating in the protocol. Our previously launched hosted service currently powers the most prominent applications in the Ethereum ecosystem, serving billions of queries per month and growing exponentially. We have an energized and vibrant community of users that are passionate about what we're building (https://twitter.com/graphprotocol/timelines/1276305113737424897).
Responsibilities
Produce compelling data-driven narratives that describe what is happening in The Graph and why.
Evangelize the use of data to support improved decision-making throughout E&N and The Graph's ecosystem.
Design and run experiments, such as A/B tests, to increase the growth, retention, and success of users of The Graph.
Apply domain knowledge of relevant topics, such as blockchain, crypto, decentralized finance (DeFi), databases, etc. to identify salient trends and patterns while exploring data sets.
Work with data engineers to define requirements for ETL and data pipelines to produce and automate new data sets to support your analysis.
Skills/ Attributes
Analytical. You effectively break down complex topics and explore new problems from principles.
Curious. You have a growth mindset when it comes to acquiring new knowledge. You enjoy pulling on a thread and seeing where it leads. You see exploring data as a creative as much as an analytical process.
Self-directed: You are able to operate independently in a remote environment and proactively identify the most important tasks to maximize your contribution. You apply domain knowledge to prioritize data-driven investigations that will have the greatest impact on strategic and technical goals.
Expert communicator: You understand that to be effective, presenting your results and recommendations clearly is as important as the analysis itself. You leverage a combination of media, including written reports, blog posts, data visualizations, spreadsheets, analytical notebooks (i.e. Jupyter, Sage, ObservableHQ), dashboards, mathematical writing (i.e. LaTeX), slide decks, and live presentations, choosing the ones most suited for the ideas being communicated.
Team player: People love working with you and your teammates value the way you introduce data-driven insights into conversations to help the team be more effective.
Query Data. You are adept at writing SQL queries and as a bonus are also familiar with GraphQL.
Strongly Recommended
Crypto Native. You have already “fallen down the crypto rabbit hole.” You are familiar with, if not an expert in, concepts like blockchain, distributed systems, bonding curves, decentralized finance (DeFi), consensus, Web3, etc.
Data Engineering. You can write Python or Javascript to post-process data, create interactive notebooks and rich data visualizations or animations.
What it's like to work at Edge & Node
Edge & Node is a globally distributed team. We work hard, but our remote-first team affords a high degree of autonomy and flexibility. Our few scheduled meetings tend to be in the morning, pacific standard time (PST). Most of our team, even at the individual contributor level, has started companies or led large teams and it shows in the way that people manage their own productivity. We're mission-oriented, and hold one another accountable with results rather than vanity metrics like time spent at your desk. If you need to book a vacation, or make a doctor's appointment, go for an afternoon run, or even just get some fresh air, we trust you to use your time effectively.
Despite being remote-first, our team is fairly tight-knit and often feels like a family. You can expect quarterly offsites (once Covid permits) in different parts of the world, where we strategize as a team, brainstorm around a whiteboard, go on team outings, have spirited and varied conversations over wine, coffee, or kombucha, and get to know each other on a personal level. We value diversity and bringing your whole self to work, including your weird hobbies, unique life experiences, cultural traditions, obscure music tastes, and whatever else makes you you. In addition to offsites, you'll have the option to travel to conferences and meetups around the world, where you'll get to know individual teammates on a more personal level and also build relationships with our users and community.
We pay competitive salaries to all team members, based on level of contribution and country of residence, and offer generous health benefits to U.S. based employees.

Our Mission
Lumen Energy is automating clean energy deployment across our cites.
To start, we’re making getting a fully-financed solar energy system for a commercial building as easy as applying for a credit card. The scope of the opportunity is massive: out of 6 million commercial buildings in the US which are responsible for 16% of all greenhouse gas emissions, most of which could save money with solar, fewer than 4% have solar systems today.
We make clean energy widely accessible by abstracting away the complexity of an underlying marketplace of installers, financiers and confusing electrical jargon. Our challenge is to parse massive datasets, deploy advanced models behind the scenes, pre-package financing, all so that we can deliver a simple, delightful, and actionable offer to our customers.
Who We Are
We are a small team of scientists, engineers, designers and entrepreneurs committed to powering our world with clean energy. We build on experience at Stripe, Google X, Shopify, and US national labs. While we're early in our journey, we are live with customers, funded by exceptional investors (soon to be announced), and looking to bring on a core team member who can help us expand our impact.
About you
You like to build. You are comfortable doing the dirty work to make datasets clean and usable. You can apply statistical methods to discover the salient features in novel data. You value reducing complexity and leaving the code base a little better than you found it.
Responsibilities include:
Aggregate and normalize energy and geographic data at a national scale
Analyze customer energy usage to find their most effective path to clean energy
Develop business analytics to keep us running smoothly
Make modeling decisions by working back from business & product needs
Collaborate with external expert advisors at universities and US national labs

What it's like to work at Edge & Node
Edge & Node is a globally distributed team. We work hard, but our remote-first team affords a high degree of autonomy and flexibility. Our few scheduled meetings tend to be in the morning, pacific standard time (PST). Most of our team, even at the individual contributor level, has started companies or led large teams and it shows in the way that people manage their own productivity. We're mission-oriented, and hold one another accountable with results rather than vanity metrics like time spent at your desk. If you need to book a vacation, or make a doctor's appointment, go for an afternoon run, or even just get some fresh air, we trust you to use your time effectively.
Despite being remote-first, our team is fairly tight-knit and often feels like a family. You can expect quarterly offsites (once Covid permits) in different parts of the world, where we strategize as a team, brainstorm around a whiteboard, go on team outings, have spirited and varied conversations over wine, coffee, or kombucha, and get to know each other on a personal level. We value diversity and bringing your whole self to work, including your weird hobbies, unique life experiences, cultural traditions, obscure music tastes, and whatever else makes you you. In addition to offsites, you'll have the option to travel to conferences and meetups around the world, where you'll get to know individual teammates on a more personal level and also build relationships with our users and community.
We pay competitive salaries to all team members, based on level of contribution and country of residence, and offer generous health benefits to U.S. based employees.

While we're early in our journey, we are live with customers, funded by exceptional investors (soon to be announced), and looking to bring on a core team member who can help us expand our impact.
About you
You like to build. You are comfortable doing the dirty work to make datasets clean and usable. You can apply statistical methods to discover the salient features in novel data. You value reducing complexity and leaving the code base a little better than you found it.
Responsibilities include:
Aggregate and normalize energy and geographic data at a national scale
Analyze customer energy usage to find their most effective path to clean energy
Develop business analytics to keep us running smoothly
Make modeling decisions by working back from business & product needs
Collaborate with external expert advisors at universities and US national labs

Edge & Node (E&N) is looking for a Data Scientist/ Analyst to help drive strategic decisions for its various platforms. E&N is the team behind The Graph, a recently launched decentralized protocol for querying open datasets, which already has thousands of users and multiple billions of dollars in tokens participating in the protocol. Our previously launched hosted service currently powers the most prominent applications in the Ethereum ecosystem, serving billions of queries per month and growing exponentially. We have an energized and vibrant community of users that are passionate about what we're building (https://twitter.com/graphprotocol/timelines/1276305113737424897).
Responsibilities
Produce compelling data-driven narratives that describe what is happening in The Graph and why.
Evangelize the use of data to support improved decision-making throughout E&N and The Graph's ecosystem.
Design and run experiments, such as A/B tests, to increase the growth, retention, and success of users of The Graph.
Apply domain knowledge of relevant topics, such as blockchain, crypto, decentralized finance (DeFi), databases, etc. to identify salient trends and patterns while exploring data sets.
Work with data engineers to define requirements for ETL and data pipelines to produce and automate new data sets to support your analysis.
Skills/ Attributes
Analytical. You effectively break down complex topics and explore new problems from principles.
Curious. You have a growth mindset when it comes to acquiring new knowledge. You enjoy pulling on a thread and seeing where it leads. You see exploring data as a creative as much as an analytical process.
Self-directed: You are able to operate independently in a remote environment and proactively identify the most important tasks to maximize your contribution. You apply domain knowledge to prioritize data-driven investigations that will have the greatest impact on strategic and technical goals.
Expert communicator: You understand that to be effective, presenting your results and recommendations clearly is as important as the analysis itself. You leverage a combination of media, including written reports, blog posts, data visualizations, spreadsheets, analytical notebooks (i.e. Jupyter, Sage, ObservableHQ), dashboards, mathematical writing (i.e. LaTeX), slide decks, and live presentations, choosing the ones most suited for the ideas being communicated.
Team player: People love working with you and your teammates value the way you introduce data-driven insights into conversations to help the team be more effective.
Query Data. You are adept at writing SQL queries and as a bonus are also familiar with GraphQL.
Strongly Recommended
Crypto Native. You have already “fallen down the crypto rabbit hole.” You are familiar with, if not an expert in, concepts like blockchain, distributed systems, bonding curves, decentralized finance (DeFi), consensus, Web3, etc.
Data Engineering. You can write Python or Javascript to post-process data, create interactive notebooks and rich data visualizations or animations.
What it's like to work at Edge & Node
Edge & Node is a globally distributed team. We work hard, but our remote-first team affords a high degree of autonomy and flexibility. Our few scheduled meetings tend to be in the morning, pacific standard time (PST). Most of our team, even at the individual contributor level, has started companies or led large teams and it shows in the way that people manage their own productivity. We're mission-oriented, and hold one another accountable with results rather than vanity metrics like time spent at your desk. If you need to book a vacation, or make a doctor's appointment, go for an afternoon run, or even just get some fresh air, we trust you to use your time effectively.
Despite being remote-first, our team is fairly tight-knit and often feels like a family. You can expect quarterly offsites (once Covid permits) in different parts of the world, where we strategize as a team, brainstorm around a whiteboard, go on team outings, have spirited and varied conversations over wine, coffee, or kombucha, and get to know each other on a personal level. We value diversity and bringing your whole self to work, including your weird hobbies, unique life experiences, cultural traditions, obscure music tastes, and whatever else makes you you. In addition to offsites, you'll have the option to travel to conferences and meetups around the world, where you'll get to know individual teammates on a more personal level and also build relationships with our users and community.
We pay competitive salaries to all team members, based on level of contribution and country of residence, and offer generous health benefits to U.S. based employees.

Query Data. You are adept at writing SQL queries and as a bonus are also familiar with GraphQL.

What it's like to work at Edge & Node
Edge & Node is a globally distributed team. We work hard, but our remote-first team affords a high degree of autonomy and flexibility. Our few scheduled meetings tend to be in the morning, pacific standard time (PST). Most of our team, even at the individual contributor level, has started companies or led large teams and it shows in the way that people manage their own productivity. We're mission-oriented, and hold one another accountable with results rather than vanity metrics like time spent at your desk. If you need to book a vacation, or make a doctor's appointment, go for an afternoon run, or even just get some fresh air, we trust you to use your time effectively.
Despite being remote-first, our team is fairly tight-knit and often feels like a family. You can expect quarterly offsites (once Covid permits) in different parts of the world, where we strategize as a team, brainstorm around a whiteboard, go on team outings, have spirited and varied conversations over wine, coffee, or kombucha, and get to know each other on a personal level. We value diversity and bringing your whole self to work, including your weird hobbies, unique life experiences, cultural traditions, obscure music tastes, and whatever else makes you you. In addition to offsites, you'll have the option to travel to conferences and meetups around the world, where you'll get to know individual teammates on a more personal level and also build relationships with our users and community.
We pay competitive salaries to all team members, based on level of contribution and country of residence, and offer generous health benefits to U.S. based employees.

Edge & Node (E&N) is looking for a Data Scientist/ Analyst to help drive strategic decisions for its various platforms. E&N is the team behind The Graph, a recently launched decentralized protocol for querying open datasets, which already has thousands of users and multiple billions of dollars in tokens participating in the protocol. Our previously launched hosted service currently powers the most prominent applications in the Ethereum ecosystem, serving billions of queries per month and growing exponentially. We have an energized and vibrant community of users that are passionate about what we're building (https://twitter.com/graphprotocol/timelines/1276305113737424897).
Responsibilities
Produce compelling data-driven narratives that describe what is happening in The Graph and why.
Evangelize the use of data to support improved decision-making throughout E&N and The Graph's ecosystem.
Design and run experiments, such as A/B tests, to increase the growth, retention, and success of users of The Graph.
Apply domain knowledge of relevant topics, such as blockchain, crypto, decentralized finance (DeFi), databases, etc. to identify salient trends and patterns while exploring data sets.
Work with data engineers to define requirements for ETL and data pipelines to produce and automate new data sets to support your analysis.
Skills/ Attributes
Analytical. You effectively break down complex topics and explore new problems from principles.
Curious. You have a growth mindset when it comes to acquiring new knowledge. You enjoy pulling on a thread and seeing where it leads. You see exploring data as a creative as much as an analytical process.
Self-directed: You are able to operate independently in a remote environment and proactively identify the most important tasks to maximize your contribution. You apply domain knowledge to prioritize data-driven investigations that will have the greatest impact on strategic and technical goals.
Expert communicator: You understand that to be effective, presenting your results and recommendations clearly is as important as the analysis itself. You leverage a combination of media, including written reports, blog posts, data visualizations, spreadsheets, analytical notebooks (i.e. Jupyter, Sage, ObservableHQ), dashboards, mathematical writing (i.e. LaTeX), slide decks, and live presentations, choosing the ones most suited for the ideas being communicated.
Team player: People love working with you and your teammates value the way you introduce data-driven insights into conversations to help the team be more effective.
Query Data. You are adept at writing SQL queries and as a bonus are also familiar with GraphQL.
Strongly Recommended
Crypto Native. You have already “fallen down the crypto rabbit hole.” You are familiar with, if not an expert in, concepts like blockchain, distributed systems, bonding curves, decentralized finance (DeFi), consensus, Web3, etc.
Data Engineering. You can write Python or Javascript to post-process data, create interactive notebooks and rich data visualizations or animations.
What it's like to work at Edge & Node
Edge & Node is a globally distributed team. We work hard, but our remote-first team affords a high degree of autonomy and flexibility. Our few scheduled meetings tend to be in the morning, pacific standard time (PST). Most of our team, even at the individual contributor level, has started companies or led large teams and it shows in the way that people manage their own productivity. We're mission-oriented, and hold one another accountable with results rather than vanity metrics like time spent at your desk. If you need to book a vacation, or make a doctor's appointment, go for an afternoon run, or even just get some fresh air, we trust you to use your time effectively.
Despite being remote-first, our team is fairly tight-knit and often feels like a family. You can expect quarterly offsites (once Covid permits) in different parts of the world, where we strategize as a team, brainstorm around a whiteboard, go on team outings, have spirited and varied conversations over wine, coffee, or kombucha, and get to know each other on a personal level. We value diversity and bringing your whole self to work, including your weird hobbies, unique life experiences, cultural traditions, obscure music tastes, and whatever else makes you you. In addition to offsites, you'll have the option to travel to conferences and meetups around the world, where you'll get to know individual teammates on a more personal level and also build relationships with our users and community.
We pay competitive salaries to all team members, based on level of contribution and country of residence, and offer generous health benefits to U.S. based employees.

Edge & Node (E&N) is looking for a Data Scientist/ Analyst to help drive strategic decisions for its various platforms. E&N is the team behind The Graph, a recently launched decentralized protocol for querying open datasets, which already has thousands of users and multiple billions of dollars in tokens participating in the protocol. Our previously launched hosted service currently powers the most prominent applications in the Ethereum ecosystem, serving billions of queries per month and growing exponentially. We have an energized and vibrant community of users that are passionate about what we're building (https://twitter.com/graphprotocol/timelines/1276305113737424897).
Responsibilities
Produce compelling data-driven narratives that describe what is happening in The Graph and why.
Evangelize the use of data to support improved decision-making throughout E&N and The Graph's ecosystem.
Design and run experiments, such as A/B tests, to increase the growth, retention, and success of users of The Graph.
Apply domain knowledge of relevant topics, such as blockchain, crypto, decentralized finance (DeFi), databases, etc. to identify salient trends and patterns while exploring data sets.
Work with data engineers to define requirements for ETL and data pipelines to produce and automate new data sets to support your analysis.
Skills/ Attributes
Analytical. You effectively break down complex topics and explore new problems from principles.
Curious. You have a growth mindset when it comes to acquiring new knowledge. You enjoy pulling on a thread and seeing where it leads. You see exploring data as a creative as much as an analytical process.
Self-directed: You are able to operate independently in a remote environment and proactively identify the most important tasks to maximize your contribution. You apply domain knowledge to prioritize data-driven investigations that will have the greatest impact on strategic and technical goals.
Expert communicator: You understand that to be effective, presenting your results and recommendations clearly is as important as the analysis itself. You leverage a combination of media, including written reports, blog posts, data visualizations, spreadsheets, analytical notebooks (i.e. Jupyter, Sage, ObservableHQ), dashboards, mathematical writing (i.e. LaTeX), slide decks, and live presentations, choosing the ones most suited for the ideas being communicated.
Team player: People love working with you and your teammates value the way you introduce data-driven insights into conversations to help the team be more effective.
Query Data. You are adept at writing SQL queries and as a bonus are also familiar with GraphQL.
Strongly Recommended
Crypto Native. You have already “fallen down the crypto rabbit hole.” You are familiar with, if not an expert in, concepts like blockchain, distributed systems, bonding curves, decentralized finance (DeFi), consensus, Web3, etc.
Data Engineering. You can write Python or Javascript to post-process data, create interactive notebooks and rich data visualizations or animations.
What it's like to work at Edge & Node
Edge & Node is a globally distributed team. We work hard, but our remote-first team affords a high degree of autonomy and flexibility. Our few scheduled meetings tend to be in the morning, pacific standard time (PST). Most of our team, even at the individual contributor level, has started companies or led large teams and it shows in the way that people manage their own productivity. We're mission-oriented, and hold one another accountable with results rather than vanity metrics like time spent at your desk. If you need to book a vacation, or make a doctor's appointment, go for an afternoon run, or even just get some fresh air, we trust you to use your time effectively.
Despite being remote-first, our team is fairly tight-knit and often feels like a family. You can expect quarterly offsites (once Covid permits) in different parts of the world, where we strategize as a team, brainstorm around a whiteboard, go on team outings, have spirited and varied conversations over wine, coffee, or kombucha, and get to know each other on a personal level. We value diversity and bringing your whole self to work, including your weird hobbies, unique life experiences, cultural traditions, obscure music tastes, and whatever else makes you you. In addition to offsites, you'll have the option to travel to conferences and meetups around the world, where you'll get to know individual teammates on a more personal level and also build relationships with our users and community.
We pay competitive salaries to all team members, based on level of contribution and country of residence, and offer generous health benefits to U.S. based employees.
